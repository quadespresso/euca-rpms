Installs Eucalyptus RPMS only, but you get to specify what version and on which machines, based on role.

Supports Eucalyptus v3.2.0 onwards.

To get started:

- edit the last line in vars/main.yml to specify the version of Eucalyptus you want to deploy
- edit site_hosts to specify which host will take on which role
